# Clt_And_Infrential

The project here consist of two parts Central Limit Theorm and Infrential Stastics. The whole Project was implemented in R markdown and knit in Pdf

### Central Limit Theorm

The CLT.pdf is a write up consisting of simulation which reinforces the practicality of Central Limit theorn

### Hypotheis T test

The Hypothesis.pdf consist of paired T test that seeks to stastically conclude whether there is a relationship between the tooth growth and dose adminstrated as well as method through which dose was adminstrated

1. (H0 -> There is no diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstraed a dosage of 2 and 1) <br>
   (H1 -> There is a Substantial Diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstrated a dosage of 2 and 1) 

2. (H0 -> There is no diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstraed a dosage of 1 and 0.5) <br>
(H1 -> There is a Substantial Diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstrated a dosage of 1 and 0.5) 

3. (H0 -> There is no diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstraed a injection using VJ Or VC supplement) <br>
(H1 -> There is a Substantial Diﬀerence in Tooth Length when adminstrated a injection using VJ or VC Supplement)
